This is a mold for half of a table tennis racket, including the blade and the handle.

The paddle is meant to be made from hand-laid composites, and the mold itself is to be 3D printed out of PETG material.

The molds are split in half to fit a 3D printer bed, and the model of the paddle itself is traced from various references online.
