this is a mesh of an alfa romeo stelvio. i was unable to find any free meshes, so i downloaded an assetto corsa mod with this car, then converted the .kn5 file to a mesh. i printed it, and there were a lot of supports which were difficult to remove.

Here is a makerworld link you can use to download and print this model. Please try it out!
